# ü™ù RickPhis

The most professional tool ever created and developed for Instagram

---
##  Explanation

RickPhis differs from others in that it is designed to test the information entered by the user and give the user a real login experience. It was developed to alert you when you enter incorrect information and encourage you to enter correct information.


# ‚ÅâÔ∏è HOW TO USE

#### The working principle of the tool is based on the hacker's arguments and these arguments are as follows:
- -s / --site 
- -ng / --ngrok-token
- -l / --lang
- -p / --port 
- -o / --output
- -c / --check
- --location / --loc
- --headless / --heoff

---
 #### -s/--site | --site 1 
 is a required argument and cannot be left blank. it must be prefixed with the number of the relevant site.

---
#### -ng/--ngrok-token | --ngrok-token 2abcd_345efgh
you have to make the adjustment by giving your own ngrok token
---
#### -l/--lang  | -l en
you can specify the language of the target page by giving a country code. if you do not use this argument, the default is English.

---
#### -p/--port |--port 8080
you can specify the connection point where the site will be published.

---
#### -o/--output  | -o login.txt
In response to this argument, it creates a file with the name and extension you provide and saves the victim's information there.

---
#### --loc/-location  | --location https://examplesite.com
When the user clicks on the sign in button they are redirected to instagram by default, but you can change this with this argument. 

---
#### -c/--check | --check
this command does not require any arguments. when given, it tests the victim's inputs with the original instagram, reflecting them as true or false to you and the victim

---
#### --heoff/--headless | --headless
this command does not require any arguments. when given, it runs the tool in headless mode.

---
-s 1 -l en -p 8080 -o test.txt --location https://www.instagram.com -c

# Problem Management
the tool is coded according to the default kali-linux settings. for example it uses the firefox driver in the check section. if you are using something different you need to change the relevant section. (file:server.py line:96)

test the respective connection several times yourself. because sometimes it can fail due to web/instagram etc. If you get a 500 error code, stop and restart the server

this tool only works on linux. not configured for windows/mac or others (it can be made to work with minor modifications)

#### ‚òéÔ∏è I have tried my best to prevent possible errors and I have made tests for this. If you still get an error that you cannot handle, open a issue or write to me via [Telegram](https://t.me/HackerRick)
